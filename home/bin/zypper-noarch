# Usage:
#
#    zypper-noarch ARCH ARGS...
# OR 
#    zypper-armv5tel ARGS...
#
# The architecture is derived from the name of the shell script, or by
# running the generic script and passing the architecture as the first argument.
# This allows us to create a softlink to the shell script for each possible architecture.
#
# E.g.:    ln -s zypper-noarch zypper-armv5tel
